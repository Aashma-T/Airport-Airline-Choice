# ✈️ Airline & Airport Choice Analysis
**Analyzing Passenger Preferences for Airlines and Airports using Machine Learning Models**

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project investigates passenger behavior regarding airport and airline selection using multiple models like:
- 📈 **Logistic Regression**
- 🌳 **Decision Trees**
- 💻 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- 🤖 **Neural Networks**

## 📋 Key Insights
- **53% of travelers** prefer **Gimpo Airport**, favoring its accessibility for domestic trips.
- **Incheon Airport** attracts **high-income travelers** and those heading to **Japan**.
- **Korean Airlines** dominates among Korean nationals, while **Foreign Airlines** are preferred for early morning international departures.
